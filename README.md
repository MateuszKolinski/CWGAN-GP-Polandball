Abstract (English)

The main goal of this project was to develop a method using neural networks that would allow for the automatic generation of characters from Polandball comics. A GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) was created to achieve this goal, which is a set of two networks, generator and discriminator, which compete against each other during the learning process. An important aspect of the project was to add the possibility of generating a specific type of character, which is possible with a CGAN (Conditional GAN). This work also includes parts of WGAN-GP (Wasserstein’s GAN with Gradient Penalty) to improve the stability of the learning process.

The project was made in Python using the PyTorch library. The training image set was a public data set of 61335 images. It was modified to eliminate unrepresentative characters and amounts to 37930 images. Then it was augmented due to the small number of characters in many classes and consists of 71539 images.

To speed up the training process, the transparency channel has been removed from the training images. It is added at the very end by applying a mask and cutting out a circle inscribed in the square of an image.

In order to determine the network architecture that allows the most faithful representation of the images from the training set, nearly 30 network models using various parameters were trained. As a result, a neural network was obtained, the generated images of which achieve an average FID (Frechet Inception Distance) factor of 149 for 194 character classes.

The main limitation of the project is the small number of characters representing many of the character classes. This results in a visual deterioration of the generated images. The classes of overrepresented balls achieve mean FID values of around 100, while those with sparse representation often exceed 180.

The end result of the project are images of Polandball characters generated by the GAN network, which can then be used to create comic book panels.
